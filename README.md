ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Alex, and I'm a software developer with a passion for bringing ideas to life. With over 3 years of experience under my belt, I specialize in Python, Typescript, React, Node, Web Services, APIs, and more. I've had the pleasure of helping enterprise clients develop distributed systems of micro services in the telecommunications sector.

When it comes to freelancing, I bring a playful yet professional attitude to every project. I'm enthusiastic about delivering top-notch results and maintaining open communication with my clients. My goal is to make your project a success and exceed your expectations every step of the way.

But my passion for technology and innovation doesn't stop at coding. I'm also interested in business, investing, and networking with others to build strong partnerships and friendships. I believe that learning from others is key to personal and professional growth.

So if you're looking for a skilled and enthusiastic freelancer to bring your ideas to life, I'm your guy! Let's collaborate and create something amazing together.
